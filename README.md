### Currently Supported Languages

- **English** (en): Full support for all features and documentation
- **Arabic** (ar): Complete right-to-left interface support

### Language Features

- **Per-server Default**: Each server can set its own default language
- **User Preference**: Users can select their preferred language
- **RTL Support**: Full support for right-to-left languages
- **Fallback System**: Missing translations fall back to English
- **Dashboard Translation**: Complete dashboard interface translation
- **Command Responses**: All command responses are localized
- **Embeds**: All embeds and visuals respect localization

### Adding New Languages

You can add support for additional languages by:

1. Creating a new file in the `src/locales` directory (copy the English file as a template)
2. Creating a corresponding file in `dashboard/locales`
3. Translating all strings to the target language
4. Adding the language code to the supported languages list in settings

The system uses a nested structure with dot notation for accessing translations, making it easy to maintain consistency across languages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### Bot Not Responding

1. Check that the bot is online in your server member list
2. Verify that the bot has the necessary permissions
3. Ensure commands are being used in channels the bot can see
4. Check the console logs for error messages
5. Restart the bot if necessary

### Dashboard Access Issues

1. Verify that the bot is running and the dashboard is active
2. Check that your Discord account has admin permissions in the server
3. Try clearing browser cache and cookies
4. Ensure your callback URL in the .env file matches your Developer Portal settings
5. Check for any firewall or network restrictions

### Database Connection Errors

1. Verify your MongoDB connection string is correct
2. Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas (if using cloud)
3. Check if your database user has the correct permissions
4. Try connecting to the database using MongoDB Compass to test connectivity
5. Check for any firewall rules blocking the connection

### Protection System False Positives

1. Adjust the thresholds in protection settings to be less sensitive
2. Add important roles to the ignored roles list
3. Add specific channels to ignored channels for anti-spam
4. Temporarily disable specific protection modules while making large changes
5. Check the action logs to understand what triggered the protection

### Common Error Codes

| Error | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `DISALLOWED_INTENTS` | Bot missing required gateway intents | Enable required intents in Developer Portal |
| `MISSING_PERMISSIONS` | Bot lacks necessary permissions | Check and update bot role permissions |
| `CONNECTION_ERROR` | Connection to Discord API failed | Check internet connection and try again |
| `DATABASE_ERROR` | MongoDB connection issues | Verify connection string and network |
